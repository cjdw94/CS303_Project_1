# CS303_Project_1
First CS 303 Project, Fall 2017

Project due on Monday, October 16, 2017.  (Development time extended by 24 hours)

/** Project due on Sunday, October 15th, 2017 */

10/16/17 - Lots of bug fixes and code clean-up done prior to the turn-in date/time.  Due to time constraints and other challenges, parens and chained prefix operators are still non-functional.

10/15/17 - Implemented extra stacks to help handle more complicated logic for precedence levels 1-4.  Lots of debugging required to tie into current project.

10/14/17 - Support added for precedence levels 1-4.  Chaining expressions with logical and comparison operations needs fixing/testing.
         - Parentheses logic still needs to be worked on

10/14/17 - Many changes with this update
         - Can evaluate more than just basic expressions, including exponentiation, negation, decrement, increment, and 'not' operations
         - Parentheses logic still untested
         - Support for precedence levels 1-4 (logical and comparison operations) still needs to be implemented

10/09/17 - First working prototype of Project 1A - an infix evaluator/parser
         - Can evaluate basic expressions
         - Foundation for parentheses logic added, but untested
         - More features on the way

10/07/17 - File structure lay-out started

10/03/17 - 1A it is!

09/26/17 - Currently deciding on 1A, 1B, or 1C
